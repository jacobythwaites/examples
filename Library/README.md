# SPARKL Libraries
SPARKL libraries are like small applications you can integrate into your mixes. 

### Using the libraries
The libraries themselves are SPARKL mixes where the starting operation, a solicit or a notify operation, is on a subroutine service.

To use a library, you need to import the service in the library and the operations on that service. 

See the [SPARKL User Guide](http://docs.sparkl.com/#TopicRoot/Extensions/Subroutines/the_subroutine_extension_c.html) to learn how subroutines work in SPARKL.
