    * Clicking **Save Link As...**

### 2. Running the mix
_If the example is not in your configuration tree yet, you need to import it into the Developer Console. See [how](https://github.com/opensparkl/examples#use_examples)._

1. Select one of these services on the Navigation Tree Panel:
   * `LocalGoods`
   * `Express`
   * `Overseas`
2. Start the service by hitting the play symbol.

Depending on which service you start, the goods will be transported by either a truck, a ship or a plane.
